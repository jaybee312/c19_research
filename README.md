# COVID19 Analysis
*Raw Data for this workbook was pulled using code found here: https://github.com/RamiKrispin/coronavirus

I'll be updating this periodically. My goal is to understand COVID19 growth.

## 3/20/2020

Added US Trends with focus on states with higher cases. Looking to understand impact of Shelter in Place or lack thereof various states.

*Impacts of shelter in place could be lagging. Other considerations for future analysis: Atypical flu cases, geographic isolation, population density, occupation, income, age, access to heathcare

## 3/21/2020

Added Italy Trends. Death growth was flat for a couple of days prior to a huge jump on 3/20. 

Added France and worldwide trends. 

*Probably worth segmenting world trends into more granular groups as combining S. Korea with US data isn't very informative.
